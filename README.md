Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) increasingly integrates our daily lives with the creation andanalysis of intelligent software and hardware, called intelligent agents. Intelligent agentscan do a variety of tasks ranging from labor work to sophisticated operations. A chatbotis a typical example of an AI system and one of the most elementary and widespreadexamples of intelligent Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) [1]. It is a computer pro-gram, which responds like a smart entity when conversed with through text or voice andunderstands one or more human languages by Natural Language Processing (NLP) [2].In the lexicon, a chatbot is deﬁned as “A computer program designed to simulate con-versation with human users, especially over the Internet” [3]. Chatbots are also knownas smart bots, interactive agents, digital assistants, or artiﬁcial conversation entities.Chatbots can mimic human conversation and entertain users butthey are not built onlyfor this. They are useful in applications such as education, information retrieval, business,and e-commerce [4]. They became so popular because there are many advantages ofchatbots for users and developers too. Most implementations are platform-independentand instantly available to users without needed installations.
